## The Case for Code Versioning
* Versioning Saves Snapshots Of Edited Code, With The Ability To Move Forward And Backward Along A History
  * Save Your Brilliant Idea For The Whole Team To Use
  * Undo That Unfortunate Choice
* The Timeline May Include Forks And Mergers Of Experiments Tried And Abandoned Or Propagated 
  * Try Three Things, Test Them In Parallel, And Keep The One You Like Best
  * Change Your Mind And Pick The Other Option That Was Almost As Fast, But Is More Flexible
* A Single Developer May Benefit From Code Versioning, But A Team Of Developers That Are Jointly Modifying A Project Is More Likely To Not Succeed Without Code Versioning 
  * That Elegant Algorithm Your Teammate Wrote Can't Be Used Until You Share Your Updated Data Prep Step
  * The Person Testing The Code You Shared Last Week Needs A Quick Fix, But You Are Halfway Through A New, Major Update

## Introducing GIT
* Global Information Tracker â€“ Aka GIT 
* GIT Is A Utility/App/Program To Facilitate Managing Code Versions
* First Created In 2005 As Part Of Linux Development Environment
* Support Multiple Local Repositories That Can Be Conditionally Synchronized With Each Other
* Each Developer Can Have Their Own Copy Of Everything, And Can Share Updates With All, Or Some Of, The Other Developers As They Are Ready For Use

## Getting GIT
* Popular Toolset With Huge Web Presence

## Getting a Repository
* git clone
  * used to create a local copy of a remote repository
  * registers the remote repository as the origin of the copy
  * need to know the URL where the remote content is served from (i.e. our github area)
  * `git clone  git@github.com:scottebemeup/ciroh-ua_website.git`

* git pull
  * used to obtain the updates present at the remote origin
  * will merge new content into your current local working copy
  * `git pull`
  * `git pull origin main`

* git fetch
  * used to get content from a remote repository
  * does not merge content into your local working copy
